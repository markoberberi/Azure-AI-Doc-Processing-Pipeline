## Why use this project?

Many organizations are looking to automate manual document processing tasks that are time-consuming and error-prone. While it is possible to automate these tasks using existing tools and services, they often require significant effort to set up and maintain.

Large language models have emerged as a powerful tool for general-purpose document processing tasks, able to handle any variety of document type and structure. Utilizing models with multimodal capabilities, such as Azure OpenAI's GPT-4o, enhances the accuracy and reliability of classifying and extracting structure data from documents by incorporating both text and image data.

This project provides the techniques and patterns to combine the capabilities of traditional OCR analysis with the power of LLMs to build a robust document processing pipeline.

## Key features

- [**Durable Functions orchestration**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-overview?tabs=in-process%2Cnodejs-v3%2Cv1-model&pivots=python): The project uses Durable Functions to orchestrate the document processing pipeline, allowing for stateful workflows and parallel processing of documents.
- [**Scalable containerized hosting**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-deploy-container-apps?tabs=acr%2Cbash&pivots=programming-language-python): The project is designed to be deployed as a containerized application using Azure Container Apps, allowing for easy scaling and management of the document processing pipeline.
- **Document data processing**: Many of the core activites for document processing are included by default, and require minimal configuration to customize to your use cases. These include:
  - [**Document data classifier**](./src/AIDocumentPipeline/documents/services/document_data_classifier.py): A service that uses Azure OpenAI's GPT-4o model to classify documents based on their content. This service can be used to classify documents into any categories you define.
  - [**Document data extractor**](./src/AIDocumentPipeline/documents/services/document_data_extractor.py): A service that combines Azure OpenAI's GPT-4o model with Azure AI Document Intelligence to extract structured data from documents using a multimodal approach, combining text and images. This service can be used to extract any structured data you define from documents using Pydantic models to define the expected output schema.
- **Model confidence scores**: Combining Azure AI Document Intelligence's model internal confidence scores with Azure OpenAI's GPT-4o `logprobs` and structured outputs features, the pipeline is able to provide a confidence score for the overall document classification and extraction process. This allows you to validate the accuracy of the results and take action if the confidence score is below a certain threshold, such as sending alerts or raising exceptions for human review.
- **Data validation**: Data is validated at every step of the process, including sub-orchestrations, ensuring that you not only receive the final output, but also the intermediate data at every step of the process.
- **OpenTelemetry**: The pipeline is configured to also support OpenTelemetry for gathering logs, metrics, and traces of the pipeline. This allows for easy monitoring and debugging of the pipeline, as well as integration with Azure Monitor and other observability tools.
- **Flexible configuration**: Using Durable Functions and separating out concerns to individual activities, the pipeline can be easily configured to support any document processing use case. The modular and extensible approach allows you to add or remove activities as needed.
- **Secure by default**: Azure Managed Identity and Azure RBAC least privilege access is used to secure the pipeline and ensure that only authorized services can access the Azure resources used in the pipeline. Additionally, opt-in to deploying the infrastructure using zero-trust principles with virtual networks and private endpoints to isolate the Azure resources from the public internet.
- **Infrastructure-as-code**: Azure Bicep modules and PowerShell deployment scripts are provided to define the Azure infrastructure for the document processing pipeline, allowing for easy deployment and management of the resources required.

## Understanding the Pipeline

![Azure AI Document Processing Pipeline](./assets/Flow.png)

This approach takes advantage of the following techniques for document data processing:

- [Document Classification with Azure OpenAI's GPT-4o Vision Capabilities](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-ai-document-processing-samples/blob/main/samples/python/classification/document-classification-gpt-vision.ipynb)
- [Document Extraction using Multi-Modal (Text and Vision) Capabilities combining Azure AI Document Intelligence and Azure OpenAI's GPT-4o](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-ai-document-processing-samples/blob/main/samples/python/extraction/multimodal/document-extraction-gpt-text-and-vision.ipynb)

### Flow

The pipeline is implemented using Durable Functions and consists of the following steps:

- Upload a batch of documents to an Azure Storage blob container.
- Once the documents are uploaded, send a message to the Azure Storage queue containing the container reference to trigger the document processing pipeline.
- The **[Process Document Batch workflow](./src/AIDocumentPipeline/documents/workflows/process_document_batch_workflow.py)** picks up the message from the queue and starts to process the request.
- Firstly, the batch document folders are retrieved from the blob container using the container reference in the message. **See [Get Document Folders](./src/AIDocumentPipeline/documents/activities/get_document_folders.py).**
  - _Note: Access to the Azure Storage account is established via a user-assigned managed identity when deployed in Azure_.
- The initial workflow then triggers the specific document processing workflow for each document folder in the batch in parallel using the **[Process Document workflow](./src/AIDocumentPipeline/documents/workflows/process_document_workflow.py)**. These process the folders as follows:
  - For each folder in the batch:
    - For each file in the folder:
      - Run the [`ClassifyDocument` activity](./src/AIDocumentPipeline/documents/activities/classify_document.py) to classify the content of the file using the [document data classifier service](./src/AIDocumentPipeline/documents/services/document_data_classifier.py), validating the classification against a pre-defined list in the pipeline.
      - If the classification is a valid extraction type, use the [document data extraction service](./src/AIDocumentPipeline/documents/services/document_data_extractor.py) using the Azure OpenAI GPT-4o model and the [strict Structured Outputs feature](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/structured-outputs?tabs=python-secure%2Cdotnet-entra-id&pivots=programming-language-python) to extract data based on a JSON schema of a type.
        - In this example, the classification and extraction is setup for invoices, as defined in the [Invoice schema object](./src/AIDocumentPipeline/invoices/models/invoice.py). The invoice data is extracted using the [Invoice extraction activity](./src/AIDocumentPipeline/invoices/activities/extract_invoice.py) which uses the [document data extractor service](./src/AIDocumentPipeline/documents/services/document_data_extractor.py) to extract the data from the document.

## Pre-built Classification & Extraction Scenarios

The accelerator comes with a pre-built [document processing pipeline](./src/AIDocumentPipeline/documents/workflows/process_document_workflow.py) that will take the folders in an Azure Storage blob container and process each document. It will first classify the document into one of the defined categories in the pipeline, and then extract the structured data from the document using the Azure OpenAI GPT-4o model with multimodal capabilities.

The pipeline is currently configured to process the following document types:

| Document Type                                                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [**Invoice**](./src/AIDocumentPipeline/invoices/activities/extract_invoice.py) | Using a [structured Invoice object](./src/AIDocumentPipeline/invoices/models/invoice.py), invoice documents can be extracted into a standard Invoice schema. |

The classification and extraction processes can be customized to suit your needs, either by modifying the existing code, or introducing new document types and workflows.

## Additional Use Cases

The pipeline can be extended to support any document processing use case, including:

- **Contracts**: Use natural language rules to extract inferred data points from clauses, such as exit dates, renewal terms, and other key information.
- **Bounded/continuous documents**: Ingest single PDFs that contain one or more documents, also known as continuous documents, detect the boundaries of each using classification techniques, and perform extractions on each sub-document.
- **General documents**: Regardless of the document type and format, whether PDF, Word, or scanned image, extract structured data from the files into your own defined schema.

## Development Environment

The repository contains a [devcontainer](./.devcontainer/README.md) that contains all the necessary tools and dependencies to run the application, and deploy the Azure infrastructure.

### Deploying to Azure

To setup an environment in Azure, you can use the following `azd` commands:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Review the parameters in the [./infra/core.bicepparam](./infra/core.bicepparam) file, or use the environment variables defined above to customize the deployment to your needs.

```bash
# Login to Azure with Azure Developer CLI (use --tenant-id for specific tenant)
azd auth login

# Build the containerized application and deploy to Azure
azd up
```

<details>
  <summary><strong>Deploy using scripts</strong></summary>

Alternatively to using the `azd` commands, you can use the provided PowerShell or Bash scripts to deploy the infrastructure and application.

```powershell
.\Setup-Environment.ps1 -DeploymentName <DeploymentName> -Location <Location>
```

```bash
bash ./setup_environment.sh <DeploymentName> <Location>
```

</details>

#### Environment Network Isolation

By default, the deployment will be configured to use public endpoints for all Azure resources, secured using Azure Managed Identity and Azure RBAC least privilege access with API key access disabled.

To deploy the environment with network isolation using a virtual network and private endpoints, set the `AZURE_NETWORK_ISOLATION` environment variable to `true` or update the `core.bicepparam` file to set the `networkIsolation` parameter to `true`.

This will deploy additional resources to the environment, including:

- **Virtual Network (VNet)**:
  - Created if `networkIsolation` is `true` (unless reusing an existing VNet).
  - Address space configurable (default: `10.0.0.0/23`).
- **Subnets within the VNet**:
  - AI Services subnet, with private endpoints for:
    - Key Vault
    - App Configuration
    - Storage
    - Cosmos DB
    - AI Foundry
    - AI Services
    - Container Registry
    - Container Apps Environment
  - Azure Container Apps Environment subnet, with delegation for `Microsoft.App/environments`.
  - Bastion subnet, for the Bastion host VM.
- **VPN Gateway** (optional):
  - Deployed if `deployVPN` is `true` and `networkIsolation` is enabled.
- **Bastion Host VM** (optional):
  - Deployed if `deployVM` is `true` and `networkIsolation` is enabled.
  - Includes Microsoft Entra ID authentication extension.

### Running the application locally

For local development and testing in the devcontainer, you can run the application locally with `F5` debugging in Visual Studio Code.

> [!NOTE]
> If you require local Azure Storage emulation, you can run `docker-compose up` to start a local Azurite instance.

### Testing the pre-built pipeline

Once an environment is setup, you can run the pre-built pipeline by uploading a batch of documents to the Azure Storage blob container and sending a message via a HTTP request or Azure Storage queue containing the container reference.

A batch of invoices is provided in the tests [Invoice Batch folder](./tests/InvoiceBatch/) which can be uploaded into an Azure Storage blob container, locally via Azurite, or in the deployed Azure Storage account.

These files can be uploaded using the Azure VS Code extension or the Azure Storage Explorer.

![Azurite Local Blob Storage Upload](./assets/Local-Blob-Upload.png)

> [!NOTE]
> Upload all of the individual folders into the container, not the individual files. This sample processed a container that contains multiple folders, each representing a customer's data to be processed which may contain one or more invoices.

#### Via the HTTP trigger

To send via HTTP, open the [`tests/HttpTrigger.rest`](./tests/HttpTrigger.rest) file and use the request to trigger the pipeline.

```http
POST http://localhost:7071/api/process-documents
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "container_name": "documents"
}
```

To run in Azure, replace `http://localhost:7071` with the `environmentInfo.value.applicationContainerAppUrl` value from the [`./infra/scripts/InfrastructureOutputs.json`](./infra/scripts/InfrastructureOutputs.json) file after deployment.

#### Via the Azure Storage queue

To send via the Azure Storage queue, run the [`tests/QueueTrigger.ps1`](./tests/QueueTrigger.ps1) PowerShell script to trigger the pipeline.

This will add the following message to the **documents** queue in the Azure Storage account, Base64 encoded:

```json
{
  "container_name": "documents"
}
```

To run in Azure, replace the `az storage message put` command with the following:

```powershell
az storage message put `
    --content $Base64EncodedMessage `
    --queue-name "documents" `
    --account-name "<storage-account-name>" `
    --auth-mode login `
    --time-to-live 86400
```

The `--account-name` parameter should be replaced with the name of the Azure Storage account deployed in the environment found in the `environmentInfo.value.azureStorageAccount` value from the [`./infra/InfrastructureOutputs.json`](./infra/InfrastructureOutputs.json) file after deployment.

## FAQ

### How are confidence scores calculated?

For Azure OpenAI, confidence scores can be calculated by first enabling the `logprobs` feature in the model request. This will return the log probabilities of the tokens generated by the model, which can be used to calculate a confidence score for structured outputs of the model by comparing the key-value pairs to their generated tokens log probabilities.

> [!NOTE]
> See the [`openai_confidence`](./src/AIDocumentPipeline/shared/confidence/openai_confidence.py) module for the implementation of calculating the confidence score for the Azure OpenAI model using a structured output.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not use prompting to generate confidence scores as part of the generated output, as this will not be a reliable source of truth. The `logprobs` feature is the only reliable technique, using the model's internal mechanisms for evaluating the probability of the tokens that it generates.

For Azure AI Document Intelligence, confidence scores are automatically calculated and returned by models for the words detected in the document. These scores can be combined with the Azure OpenAI model confidence scores to calculate an overall confidence score when combining the two techniques for higher accuracy extractions.

> [!NOTE]
> See the [`document_intelligence_confidence`](./src/AIDocumentPipeline/shared/confidence/document_intelligence_confidence.py) module for the implementation of calculating the confidence score for the Azure AI Document Intelligence model using a structured output.

### I deployed with network isolation, how can I access the resources?

When deploying with network isolation, you can access the Azure resources using either the deployed VPN Gateway or Bastion host. The VPN Gateway allows you to connect to the Azure resources using a VPN client, while the Bastion host allows you to connect to a jumpbox VM in the Azure environment using the Azure portal.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using the jumpbox VM, you can use the [./infra/scripts/Initialize-VM.ps1](./infra/scripts/Initialize-VM.ps1) script to install the necessary tools and dependencies on the VM to build and deploy the application.
